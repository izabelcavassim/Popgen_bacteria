This repository was created to upload the scripts used for population genetics analysis of the Population genetics paper of sympatric species of Rhizobium.

## Primary steps 
* Orthology: https://github.com/izabelcavassim/Rhizobium_analysis/#orthologous-identification-proteinortho
* Codon-aware alignment: https://github.com/izabelcavassim/Rhizobium_analysis/#codon-aware-alignment

## SNP-calling
python script: https://github.com/izabelcavassim/Rhizobium_analysis/#snp-calling

## Classifying synonymous and non-synonymous sites 

python script: hdf5_call_variants.py

Estimating transition transversion bias and non-synonysmous and synonymous sites
